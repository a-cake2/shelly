it should be painfully obvious by now that if you look up "shelly" in the discord server i have the most messages about it outside orson and its probably because i obtained a very weird obsession towards shelly even though i never liked anthropomorphic characters in particular i guess shelly's armor kinda gives me away oh well i just really like shelly's scorpion female thing i think it sets it apart from other furry characters as in my opinion scorpion characters are a very unpopular yet fun concept but in all honesty i really just think shes kind of neat alongside her mute thing of which leaves room for interpretation and im sure noone will notice if i say meowdread i love you and also i hope i can give my utmost respect away for mutes with this locale even though im not mute also its a github fork simply because i wanna do this on my free school computer time but dont have good means outside github to do so
