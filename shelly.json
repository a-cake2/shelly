They tend to leave these nasty, often infected gashes in me... It hurts, but the odd coloring on my leg tends to go away after I rub some of those glowy fruits that grow here, on the wound. Things suck, but at least we're surrounded by nature's antibiotics..",

Next thing I know, I wake up in one of those lifepods, about to launch from our lab and soon to fly towards whatever this gray little planet is...",
                "It's not just me. Almost everyone sent down here apparently is able to see their health status in their own mind, too... It feels... Artificial..? I know none of us had this kind of vision before. I wonder if it's from one of those chips that they secretly pumped into us.",

If I take a bit of that red blood that I would sometimes find in the white boxes lying around, and I splash it on one of those terminals, the door next to it will open!

The moment they walked through one of those holes and went outside... They started behaving really odd... They collapsed and eventually lost their pulse... Something is out there. Something is preventing us from leaving. Is it our captors? Forcing us to stay here..?",
